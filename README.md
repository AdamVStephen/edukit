# EDUKIT Inverted Pendulum

This repository contains a modified version of the firmware for the UCLA/STM EDUKIT inverted pendulum apparatus.
The revised application restricts the operation of the motor controller to accept external requests
over a serial connection, from a controller that is also reading back the rotor encoder position
from the same serial connection.

Original author of the modifications : Jawad Muhammad, software engineer at UKAEA.
